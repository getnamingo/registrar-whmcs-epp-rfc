This repository is **deprecated** and is no longer maintained.

The functionality provided here has been replaced by a more flexible and actively maintained solution:

👉 **WHMCS EPP Registrar**

## Why this project is deprecated

This module was originally designed specifically for ICANN-based registrar workflows.  
It has since been superseded by a **generic EPP registrar module** that:

- Supports both **gTLD and ccTLD** registries
- Provides a cleaner configuration model
- Is actively maintained and extended
- Is not tied to ICANN-only assumptions

---

## What should you do?

- **New installations** → use  
  https://github.com/getnamingo/whmcs-epp-registrar

- **Existing installations** → plan migration to the generic EPP module

No new features or fixes will be added to this repository.
